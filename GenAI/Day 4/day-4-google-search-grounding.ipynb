    "# Day 4 - Google Search grounding with the Gemini API\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this optional notebook, you will use [Google Search](https://google.com/) results with the Gemini API in a technique called grounding, where the model is connected to verifiable sources of information. Using search grounding is similar to using the RAG system you implemented earlier in the week, but the Gemini API automates a lot of it for you. The model generates Google Search queries and invokes the searches automatically, retrieving relevant data from Google's index of the web and providing links to search suggestions that support the query, so your users can verify the sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "## New in Gemini 2.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Gemini 2.0 Flash provides a generous Google Search quota as part of the [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing). If you switch models back to 1.5, you will need to [enable billing](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) to use Grounding with Google Search, or you can [try it out in AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/). See the [earlier versions of this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-4-google-search-grounding?scriptVersionId=207458162) for guidance. "
