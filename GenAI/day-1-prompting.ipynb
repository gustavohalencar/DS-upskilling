You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompting using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n## For help\n\n**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n\n## New for Gemini 2.0!\n\nThis course material was first launched in November 2024. The AI and LLM space is moving incredibly fast, so we have made some updates to use the latest models and capabilities.\n\n* These codelabs have been updated to use the Gemini 2.0 family of models.\n* The Python SDK has been updated from `google-generativeai` to the new, unified [`google-genai`](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai) SDK.\n  * This new SDK works with both the developer Gemini API as well as Google Cloud Vertex AI, and switching is [as simple as changing some fields](https://pypi.org/project/google-genai/#:~:text=.Client%28%29-,API%20Selection,-By%20default%2C%20the).\n* New model capabilities have been added to the relevant codelabs, such as \"thinking mode\" in this lab.\n* Day 1 includes a new [Evaluation codelab](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-evaluation-and-structured-output).","metadata":{"id":"csNPnkuCobmG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get started with Kaggle notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome!

From its mythical origins as a gift from Athena to its ubiquitous presence on modern tables, the olive and its oil have shaped cultures, economies, and even health practices. Its enduring importance in modern society stems from its rich nutritional profile, its culinary versatility, its profound cultural significance, and its burgeoning role in sustainable agriculture. Understanding these facets reveals why the olive remains a vital and influential component of contemporary life.\n\nPerhaps the most immediately recognizable contribution of the olive is its nutritional value.

The usual suspects were present: Mrs. Gable tending her roses, the perpetually barking chihuahua, Pablo, and the relentless, droning hum of the lawnmower next door. Clementine yawned. Boredom, like a rogue hairball, threatened to choke her spirit.\n\nThen, a flash of turquoise caught her eye. A robin, bolder than most, had landed on the oak tree in the yard, a glittering ribbon dangling from its beak. It wasn't just any ribbon; it was the shimmering, satin ribbon that had adorned Clementine's favorite scratching post, ripped off during a particularly enthusiastic session.\n\nA thrill, a purring-rumbling adventure, ignited within her. This was it. This was her escape from the monotonous meow-diocrity of suburban life.\n\nClementine leaped silently from the windowsill, landing with the grace only a cat can possess. She stalked the robin, a tiny, furry ninja, her emerald eyes narrowed in concentration. The robin, oblivious, flitted further into the yard, the ribbon trailing like a captured star.\n\nThe hunt led her past the dreaded Pablo, whose bark, usually a shrill symphony of annoyance, was rendered insignificant by Clementine's single-minded focus. She navigated the prickly rose bushes, dodging thorns with practiced ease, her paws padding softly on the damp earth.\n\nThe robin finally landed on the back fence, a crumbling wooden structure that marked the boundary between her quiet yard and the wild, untamed woods beyond. Clementine hesitated. The woods… they were a place of whispering leaves and rustling shadows, a place she had only glimpsed from the safety of her sunbeam-dusted perch.\n\nBut the ribbon, dangling tantalizingly close, beckoned.\n\nWith a surge of feline bravery, she scrambled up the fence, claws finding purchase in the weathered wood. Perched precariously on the top, she saw a world transformed. The woods exploded with green – emerald ferns unfurled like secret scrolls, ancient trees stood sentinel, their gnarled branches reaching for the sky. The air hummed with the buzz of insects and the sweet scent of damp earth and wildflowers.\n\nClementine dropped into the undergrowth, landing with a soft thud. The woods welcomed her, embracing her in a symphony of smells and sounds. She explored, her senses on high alert. She chased butterflies with wings like stained glass, stalked plump bumblebees buzzing around honeysuckle vines, and drank from a cool, mossy spring.\n\nShe even faced a small, fluffy squirrel, who, instead of fleeing in terror, chattered indignantly at her before scampering up a tree. Clementine, used to the groveling admiration of humans, found the squirrel's defiance strangely exhilarating.\n\nAs dusk began to paint the sky in hues of lavender and rose, Clementine realized she was lost. Panic, a foreign feeling, clawed at her throat. The woods, once enchanting, now seemed menacing.\n\nThen, a familiar scent drifted on the breeze: Mrs. Gable’s roses. Hope surged through her. She followed the scent, pushing through the undergrowth, until finally, she saw a gap in the trees.\n\nShe emerged into her own backyard, blinking in the twilight. Mrs. Gable was on the porch, calling her name in a worried voice. Pablo, surprisingly, was silent, his tail wagging tentatively.\n\nClementine ran to Mrs. Gable, rubbing against her legs and purring with relief. Mrs. Gable scooped her up, burying her face in Clementine's soft fur.\n\nLater, nestled in her favorite sunbeam, Clementine licked her paws, the adventure already fading into a hazy memory. The ribbon, now discarded by the robin, lay forgotten on the fence. She was safe, warm, and loved.\n\nBut as she drifted off to sleep, she dreamt of whispering leaves, defiant squirrels, and the thrill of the untamed woods. She knew, with a certainty that only a cat can possess, that this was not her last adventure.

He napped in sunbeams, terrorized dust bunnies, and demanded head scratches precisely four times a day. His world consisted of Mrs. Higgins’ cozy cottage and the postage-stamp-sized garden out back, bounded by a rather pathetic, mossy stone wall.\n\nOne crisp autumn afternoon, the familiar routines grated. The sunbeams weren't quite warm enough, the dust bunnies had proved alarmingly agile, and Mrs. Higgins, for some unimaginable reason, opted for crochet over cranial massage. Restlessness pawed at Jasper like a badger in a burrow. He eyed the crumbling stone wall, a boundary he’d mostly ignored. Today, it beckoned.\n\nWith a surge of unheard-of daring, Jasper scaled the wall, his claws finding purchase in the yielding mortar. The world exploded in a tapestry of sensory overload: scents of pine needles, damp earth, and something enticingly wild that Mrs. Higgins never knitted.\n\nBeyond the wall was a forest, a tangled wilderness that swallowed sunlight. Overcoming a brief tremor of panic, Jasper decided, firmly, to be a mountain lion. Or at least a very small, ginger approximation thereof.\n\nHis adventure began. He batted at shimmering dragonflies with his hunting-honed skill. He scaled a truly majestic (though moderately inclined) oak tree, becoming briefly lost in its canopy until the promise of birdsong beckoned him down. He met (and thoroughly routed) a very self-important field mouse, earning himself an imaginary badge of bravery.\n\nHe then encountered Penelope, a calico with fur the color of sunset and a disdainful flick of her tail. Penelope lived on the wrong side of the woods, among a crumbling estate he had glimpsed in faded storybooks read by Mrs. Higgins, filled with gargoyles, whispers of elegance and more than enough mice in varying flavors, Jasper discovered the first chance she led him around showing it.\n\nThey traded barbs, Penelope’s sharp and polished, Jasper’s clumsy but surprisingly effective (\"Well, at least MY owner can tell I’m ginger and not permanently mud-splattered!\"), as she called him one morning when she managed to douse him when drinking after she took one big run behind his tail. He managed a growl just to keep appearances, and even she was convinced just for that fleeting moment; and that was her real treat more than if he attacked outright.\n\nDays melted into a shared symphony of chases through brambles, purr-infused midday snuggles in a discarded sunbeam, and philosophical debates about the optimal way to ambush voles (Penelope preferred aerial assaults, Jasper a sneak-and-pounce). They spoke for all manner of moments of tales in an estate he discovered more about then all Mrs. Higgins and him back and told it as stories like Penelope often did about many forgotten names her elder mentors she had never see; still in memory and shared as lessons. He never expected any. \n\nEventually, twilight draped itself across the woods in shades of indigo and amethyst, and an insistent tug began to ripple in Jasper's tummy. Home, with its warm hearth and consistent supper, suddenly held a strong and comforting pull. It hadn’t fully eclipsed the wonder with Penelope though but something he must have felt was always inevitable, a new discovery and yet so far still known to him inside too like all she showed.\n\nWith a final flick of their tails, exchanging no words even then – but the sentiment shone like the fading light around her and on him – and whispered and not fully grasped in just meaning and true definition except from something they have only just begun to feel - she turned and stepped back among the stone entrance, he toward wall to climb toward something comfortable, and they just felt eachothers meaning just like words often hid, a way from there, just always close. Jasper trotted back toward the stone wall, weary and gloriously satisfied and in touch with that of home.\n\nHe scrambled back over the wall into Mrs. Higgins’ garden, unnoticed. He went inside from back where familiar comforting arms stretched, rubbed noses on old cardigan covered in yarn pieces, ate then slept without complaint of her day because now inside hers in thought if hers wasn’t he too, and his still with the sun, and with love where nothing need anymore explanation than to accept and sleep for an adventurer home after one that surely happened many times after.

This prompt will typically include:\n\n    *   The branch name, often color-coded.\n    *   Symbols to indicate the status of the repository (e.g., whether there are uncommitted changes).\n    *   Potentially, the name of the virtual environment being used.\n\n3.  **Color and Themes:** The script allows you to customize the colors and overall look of the prompt through themes.\n\n4.  **Asynchronous Updates:** It often uses asynchronous Git commands (using `async_run` or `async_run_zsh`) to fetch remote status updates in the background, so the prompt doesn't block your terminal while waiting for Git to respond.\n\n**Why would you use it?**\n\n*   **At-a-glance Git Status:**  Quickly see the state of your Git repository directly in your prompt without having to run `git status` constantly.\n*   **Improved Workflow:**  Makes it easier to manage your Git workflow by providing immediate feedback on your repository's state.\n*   **Customization:** Allows you to tailor your prompt to your preferences with colors, symbols, and information.\n*   **Virtual Environment Awareness:** Integrates smoothly with Python and Node.js virtual environments, displaying which environment is active.\n\n**How to use it (typically):**\n\n1.  Download or clone the script.\n2.  Source the script in your `.bashrc` (or `.zshrc` for Zsh) file. This means adding a line like `source /path/to/git-prompt.sh` to your shell's configuration file.\n3.  Open a new terminal, or source your `.bashrc` file (`source ~/.bashrc`) to apply the changes.\n\nAfter installation, your command prompt should now reflect the status of the Git repository you're currently working in.  You can further customize it by modifying the script's configuration variables (colors, symbols, etc.).\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":45},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Learn more\n\nTo learn more about prompting in depth:\n\n* Check out the whitepaper issued with today's content,\n* Try out the apps listed at the top of this notebook ([TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/), [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) and [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/)),\n* Read the [Introduction to Prompting](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-intro) from the Gemini API docs,\n* Explore the Gemini API's [prompt gallery](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/prompts) and try them out in AI Studio,\n* Check out the Gemini API cookbook for [inspirational examples](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/examples/) and [educational quickstarts](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/).\n\nBe sure to check out the codelabs on day 3 too, where you will explore some more advanced prompting with code execution.\n\nAnd please share anything exciting you have tried in the Discord!\n\n*- [Mark McD](https://linktr.ee/markmcd)*","metadata":{"id":"2a8266d97ce5"}}]}
