If you are having any issues, please [check out the troubleshooting steps there](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting#Get-started-with-Kaggle-notebooks).\n\nTwo big limitations of LLMs are 1) that they only \"know\" the information that they were trained on, and 2) that they have limited input context windows. A way to address both of these limitations is to use a technique called Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG. A RAG system has three stages:\n\n1. Indexing\n2. Retrieval\n3. Generation\n\nIndexing happens ahead of time, and allows you to quickly look up relevant information at query-time. When a query comes in, you retrieve relevant documents, combine them with your instructions and the user's query, and have the LLM generate a tailored answer in natural language using the supplied information. This allows you to provide information that the model hasn't seen before, such as product-specific knowledge or live weather updates.\n\nIn this notebook you will use the Gemini API to create a vector database, retrieve answers to questions from the database and generate a final answer. You will use [Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/), an open-source vector database. With Chroma, you can store embeddings alongside metadata, embed documents and queries, and search your documents.\n\n## For help\n\n**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n","metadata":{"id":"CsVPnR8VbXE6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Setup\n\nFirst, install ChromaDB and the Gemini API Python SDK.","metadata":{"id":"akuOzK4dJl3j"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip uninstall -qqy jupyterlab kfp  # Remove unused conflicting packages\n!pip install -qU \"google-genai==1.7.0\" \"chromadb==0.6.3\"","metadata":{"id":"JbXe7Oodc5dP","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2026-01-23T17:21:15.909618Z","iopub.execute_input":"2026-01-23T17:21:15.910035Z","iopub.status.idle":"2026-01-23T17:21:52.269141Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2026-01-23T17:21:15.909998Z","shell.execute_reply":"2026-01-23T17:21:52.268030Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\u001b[31mERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed.
